    <p>Our aim is to examine the extent to which the film industry, as a mirror of societal norms, perpetuates stereotypes about women, whether in terms of domestic roles, 
    leadership doubts or standards of beauty. We will also explore regional variations: American cinema's emphasis on masculinity in blockbusters, 
    the artistic and intellectual nature of European films, with perhaps greater gender equity, and Bollywood's family-centric themes, which affect the roles of 
    female actors. Our analysis begins with the changing roles of women in films, and then compares them across different film industries.</p>
