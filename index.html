  <p>How have the roles and representations of women in films evolved over time, and in what ways do they differ across diverse cultural contexts?</p>

  <p>Our aim is to examine the extent to which the film industry, as a mirror of societal norms, perpetuates stereotypes about women, whether in terms of domestic roles, 
    leadership doubts, or standards of beauty. We will also explore regional variations: American cinema's emphasis on masculinity in blockbusters, the artistic and intellectual 
    nature of European films, with perhaps greater gender equity, and Bollywood's family-centric themes, which affect the roles of female actors. Our analysis begins with 
    the changing roles of women in films, and then compares them across different film industries.</p>
