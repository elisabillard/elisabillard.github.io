  <p>Now that we have analyzed the general inequalities that women face in the movie industry and the impact of gender on a movie's success, we will explore whether the cultural background of a country can alter this impact, since stereotypes about women vary from culture to culture. 
    To do so, we will examine how gender influences movies across three geographical areas—USA, India, and Europe—each representing significant movie industries: Hollywood, Bollywood and European movies. 
    But are our preconceived ideas true when it comes to the presence of women in the plot ? That’s what we will try to figure out!</p>
    
  <p>Our aim is to analyze the percentage of women in films in our different regions of interest: USA, India and Europe. To do so, we can study the following map, which represents the percentage of women appearing in films around the world.</p>

  <p>If we compare the different regions we're interested in, we can see that India has one of the highest percentages of women in movies, at almost 35%. The United States is a little behind with a percentage of women of around 30%.  In Europe, on the other hand, we can see a segmentation 
  between Eastern and Western Europe, where the percentage is much higher in the West (around 30%) than in the East (around 20%). </p>

  <p>To address potential confounding variables that might influence the gender representation between the USA, Europe and India, we first exactly match the movies on the release year and the movie genre. As a result, the following analysis
  is done on triplets of movies from the 3 regions of interest that have the same release year and genre. However, it is crucial to recognize the challenges and limitations of this approach. Exact matching based solely on release year and movie genre might not account for all potential confounders or nuances influencing gender representation in films. Factors like cultural context, directorial choices, scriptwriting, and societal norms beyond genre and release year could still impact the portrayal of women in movies.</p>

  <p>The test results reveal an unexpected trend: European movies tend to feature approximately 2% fewer feminine characters compared to American and Indian cinema. This finding challenges common perceptions, as European cinema might be stereotypically associated with a cultural inclination towards more balanced or prominent portrayals of feminine characters, distinct from American or Indian cinema. </p>
