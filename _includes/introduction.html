  <p>You may have heard of outdated beliefs such as that women are destined for cooking and childcare, or that they are not suited to management positions. 
  Beyond these stereotypes, women are also confronted with specific beauty standards, such as being thin, having long blond hair, being young or having smooth skin. 
  Notably, these beauty standards are reflected in the movie industry, with famous actresses such as Marilyn Monroe, Brigitte Bardot, Grace Kelly, and more contemporary figures 
  like Margot Robbie, embodying them.</p>

  <p>An interesting question to ask is whether stereotypes about women's roles also manifest in the movie industry, similar to how beauty standards do. 
  What types of characters do women portray, and how often do they occupy main roles compared to men?</p>

  <p>Additionally, diverse cultural backgrounds in various countries can shape the representation of women differently, and we can for example compare Hollywood, Bollywood, and European cinema. 
  One might anticipate, for instance, that Hollywood places a strong emphasis on masculinity in its blockbuster productions. 
  European films may lean towards more artistic and intellectual narratives, potentially fostering greater gender equality. 
  Meanwhile, Bollywood's focus on family-centric themes could impact the roles and portrayal of actresses in the industry.</p>

  <p>In this analysis, we want to determine whether and to what extent stereotypes persist in this industry. How are women represented in movies ? 
  What type of characters do they interpret ? Can women have an impact on a movie's success ?</p>
