    <p>First, we need to explore quantitatively the extent of inequalities in the representation of women: 
        are actresses really younger than actors? What is the difference between the proportion of actresses and actors? 
        Which movie genres are more prone to inequalities?</p>

    <p>Let’s look at the age of actors and actresses! The age is a first easy insight into our data, and at the same time 
        quite symptomatic of gender stereotypes. As expected actresses are usually younger than actors: </p>

    h4>T-test Distribution of Age between Actors and Actresses</h4>

        <table border="1">
            <tr>
                <th>P-value</th>
                <th>Statistic</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>0.0</td>
                <td>-128.5</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

    <p>And the observed difference is significantly different with a nearly null p-value. 
        We are not surprised by this information as this is the first impression we get when looking at most popular movies. 
        Older men and younger women in relationships are the common trope of many movies. 
        This is symptomatic of societal gender norms, women are at the peak of their beauty and career when they are young, 
        while men age like good wine. </p>

    <p>Another interesting first insight is to examine the representation of men and women on screen, 
        meaning looking at the distribution of female and male characters in the movies from our dataset. 
        Let’s plot the proportion of female characters: </p>

    <iframe src="/assets/plots/percentage_female.html" width="800" height="500" frameborder="0"></iframe>

    <p> We observe a very skewed distribution! Indeed, many films have no female characters at all. 
        How can this be?  We can't be sure that no women appear in the movie, but they don't appear in the list of characters, 
        which means that they are not among the most seen characters. What's more, the same is not true for men: 
        none of the films have no male characters at all! 
        We see a clear inequality in the representation of men and women on screen.</p>

    <p>Does this representation change with movie genres ? We want to see if some genres are more equal, 
        at least in terms of the proportion of characters. Let’s plot this distribution for the 16 most represented 
        genres in our data set:</p>

    <iframe src="/assets/plots/percentage_by_genre.html" width="800" height="500" frameborder="0"></iframe>

    <p>We observe that the movie genre with the lowest percentage of female characters is 'short film,' 
        closely followed by 'action' and 'adventure,' as well as 'crime fiction', with a percentage of female characters 
        lower than 30%. Among the 16 most represented genres, the one with the highest percentage of female characters 
        is the 'Romance' genre. This illustrates the perception that men are often portrayed as adventurous and 
        courageous heroes, while women are predominantly defined by their romantic relationships. </p>
