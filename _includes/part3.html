<p>Now that we have understood the differences in women's representation in the movie industry itself, we are interested in the consequences 
they have on the public! It seems that blockbusters often feature men as their main characters. When examining the 10 movies with the highest box-office 
revenue of all time on the Wikipedia page <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films">List of highest-grossing films</a>, we see that 
none of these movies showcase a female character as the sole main character, in contrast to several movies where a male character takes on the role of the sole main character.</p>

Therefore, we are interested in analyzing whether the gender of the main character or the percentage of female characters in a movie has an impact on its success.

<h4>Perception of the public</h4>
<p>First, we conducted an observational study to examine how the proportion of female characters in a movie correlates with its rating. 
We initially divided the dataset into two distinct groups: movies with a percentage of female characters above the median (treatment group) 
and those below the median (control group). Subsequently, to enhance the study's robustness, we executed exact matching based on release 
year (binned into 5-year intervals), country, and movie genre. Following this, we applied linear regression analysis, obtaining the subsequent results:</p>

<h4>Linear Regression  AverageRating ~ Percentage of Female Characters </h4>

    <div class="center-table">
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th></th>
                <th>Coef</th>
                <th>P-value</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Intercept</th>
                <td>6.2102</td>
                <td>0.000</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>PercentageofFemale</th>
                <td>-0.0019</td>
                <td>0.000</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>

<p>To conclude this first causal analysis, we see that the percentage of female characters has a significant negative impact on the movie 
rating at the 95% significance level, as the p-value is smaller than 0.05, and the coefficient is slightly negative. Thus the rating 
given by IMDB users is slightly decreasing with an increasing percentage of women in the movie. </p>

<p>The main character of a movie is also very important: indeed, the portrayal of the main character influences how audiences perceive the movie's 
themes, messages, and overall quality. Thatâ€™s why we performed a second observational study, but this time on the gender of the main character's 
influence on the movie rating. Like in the previous causal analysis, we performed matching, where the treatment group consists of movies for which the 
main character is a woman, and the control group consists of movies for which the main character is a man. We then performed a linear regression to see 
how the main character influences the movie rating.</p>

<h4>Linear Regression: Average Rating ~ Feminine Main Character</h4>

    <div class="center-table">
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th></th>
                <th>Coef</th>
                <th>P-value</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Intercept</th>
                <td>6.3579</td>
                <td>0.000</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>MainCharFemale</th>
                <td>-0.0769</td>
                <td>0.000</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>

<p>The presence of a slightly negative coefficient, coupled with a p-value below 0.05, suggests that movies featuring a woman as the main character tend to receive lower 
ratings from IMDb users compared to those with a man as the main character.One hypothesis is that viewers might have preconceived ideas about the type of roles women should 
play in movies. Therefore, when female characters challenge or deviate from these expectations, it can lead to discomfort or dissatisfaction among some audience members, affecting 
their perception of the film. But even though we conducted a causal analysis, a bias might be introduced by the audience diversity of IMDB or by the success of the director of the movies.</p>

<h4>Perception of the film industry</h4>
<p>The Oscars are one of the most prestigious and globally recognized awards in the entertainment industry, specifically for the film sector. Organized by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, 
the Oscars honor excellence in various categories related to filmmaking. Thus, to explore the potential influence of the main character's gender on a movie's reception within the film industry, we sought 
to examine its correlation with the likelihood of receiving an Oscar nomination.</p>

<p>We first excluded gendered Oscar categories for actors and actresses, which would bias our results;  we also excluded categories that do not seem to be related to the main character, and so neither to its gender.
Then we conducted a new causal analysis by matching exactly movies on their release-year period, their genre and their production country. Then we performed logit regression to predict if a movie was likely to be 
nominated for the Oscars based on the gender of its main character.</p>

<div class="center-table">
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th></th>
            <th>Coef</th>
            <th>P-value</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Intercept</th>
            <td>-2.0854</td>
            <td>0.000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>MainCharFemale</th>
            <td>0.1103</td>
            <td>0.171</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>

<p>Our logit regression analysis revealed that the gender of the main character does not emerge as a statistically significant factor in predicting a movie's likelihood of receiving an Oscar nomination. 
Despite our exploration into this aspect, our findings suggest that the portrayal of the main character's gender may not really influence the movie's recognition by the Oscars.</p>

<p>While an Oscar nomination holds significant weight as a recognition of a film's excellence, it's essential to recognize that it represents only one facet of the film industry's reception. The assessment 
of a movie's success and reception within the industry is multifaceted, encompassing various critical reviews, festival recognitions, and other awards.</p>
